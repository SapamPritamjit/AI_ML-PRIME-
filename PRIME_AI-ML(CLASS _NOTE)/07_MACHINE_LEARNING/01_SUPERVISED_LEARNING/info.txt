Supervised ML trains algorithms on labeled datasets, meaning each input has a known correct output,
to learn patterns and predict outcomes for new data.


Steps (ML):-
1) Data preprocess + feature engineering
2) Select Model
3) Train / Test split
4) Underfit / overfit

Types of problems :-
1) Regression :- Output is a continuous numerical value.
2) Classification :- Output is a category or class 
(Binary Classification -> it only have 2 possible class or category
eg :-Spam / Not spam
Yes / No
Disease / No disease)


(multi-class Classification -> it has more than two mutually exclusive classes, and each data point 
belongs to exactly one class.
eg :- Digit recognition (0–9)
Animal type: cat / dog / horse
Sentiment: positive / neutral / negative)


(multi label classification -> one data point can belong to multiple classes at the same time.
eg :- Email: spam + important
Image: person + car + outdoor
Movie: action + comedy)
