r --> read mode
w --> write mode
when we use write mode it erast the entire previous data and rewrite thenew data

readline --> read line by line

There is a pointer type concept when we read write or making any changes in the code


MODE :-
r --> reading (Default)
w --> writing truncates file first
x --> create new and open for writting
a --> write appends at end
b --> binary mode
t --> text mode (Default)
+ --> open disk file for update (r & w)
r+ -> it write the text at the beginning(where the pointer start) and read the old data
w+ -> it wipe out the old data and start writing a new data and it return blank because
there is no old data remain to read
a+ -> it write the data at the end(where the pointer end) and read the old data


WITH key help to close the file automtically once the entire operation is done


To delate a file we need to use a special module called os(operating system)
